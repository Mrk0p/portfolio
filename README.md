# 🧑‍💻 Full Stack Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal **developer portfolio** – a fully responsive, interactive website created to highlight my skills, experience, and projects as a Full Stack Web Developer. This site is designed using **modern tools and best practices**, with a clean UI and smooth user experience.

## 📌 Project Overview

This portfolio is more than just a static profile – it's a reflection of my practical knowledge and developer workflow. I’ve used **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing, **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling, and **TypeScript** for type safety. Animations are powered by **Framer Motion**, and the UI is structured with **Shadcn UI components** for clean, accessible design.

### 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- ⚡ **Animated Transitions**: Smooth animations with Framer Motion to enhance interactivity.
- 💼 **Project Showcase**: Includes links to live projects and GitHub repos.
- 📄 **Resume Section**: Downloadable resume with contact details.
- 🌐 **Deployed on Vercel** for performance, CI/CD, and scalability.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
